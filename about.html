        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm Web Dev Si, a Frontend Developer from Canada.</p>
        <p>I have been working online in some form or another since 2008.</p>

        <h2>My Achievements</h2>
        <p>I have recently completed a year on Codecademy, earning many certificates, and am now using the Frontend Masters platform as a refresher, and to further my developer development.</p>
        
        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>Aside from becoming a high performing and knowledgeable developer, I want to help people are in a similar position to me, learn how to find their first job in tech.</p>
        <p>I will be documenting my journey, and hope it can provide future students a better roadmap than what I had.</p>
